# Vyper-Dutch-Auction-Smart-Contract
A dutch auction smart contract for token buying, written in Vyper.
Dutch Auctions are very common for NFT sales, but have not often been use for the initial coin offering.
A Dutch Auction would be useful for this, so I wrote this contract for anybody looking to use it. It exists online in Solidity, but I could not find one in Vyper.
Must create a way to deliver the token for your specific token, as that is not included in this code.
The folder is an eth-brownie folder and includes the tests I wrote in pytest.
